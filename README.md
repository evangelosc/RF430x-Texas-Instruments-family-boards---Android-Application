# RF430x-Texas-Instruments-family-boards---Android-Application
My Android application for NFC communication - RealTime data readout. It can work with any RF430x Texas Instruments family boards.

It is an open source android application coded by myself in terms of a summer internship at the University of Manchester, UK.
I would like to thank Professor Zhirun Hu for having me in his lab.
